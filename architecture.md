# Architecture

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | ESP-IDF (C/C++) |
| UI | LVGL, rendered to the e-ink panel |
| Host link | BLE HID keyboard (types credentials), BLE FIDO2 (CTAP2) |
| Network | Wi-Fi: syncing data and configuring the device |
| Storage | encrypted file with settings and credentials |

Reference ESP-IDF + LVGL project: `../../ai-remote/approver-esp32` ([GitHub](https://github.com/merlokk/ai-remote/tree/main/approver-esp32)).

## Code layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `main/` | `app_main`: OTA self-confirm, NVS init, startup |
| `components/` | app components (`cli`: USB command line) |
| `utils/` | host-side Python tools over the USB console (`spiffs.py`: ls/info/rm/get/put; `ble.py`: ble commands, `kb` text quoting) |
| `drivers/` | hardware drivers, one component per device (`hardware`: SoC info; `spiffs_fs`: SPIFFS on `spiffs` at `/spiffs`, never formatted, it holds stock data on the X4 Pro; `ble`, `ble_kb`, `ble_fido`: see BLE) |

## BLE

NimBLE, peripheral, one connection. Stack is off at boot (`ble on`).

| Driver | Role |
|---|---|
| `ble` | stack on/off, advertising (HID + FIDO UUIDs), bonding (NVS), DIS + Battery services; profile drivers register GATT services and GAP listeners before `ble on` |
| `ble_kb` | HID over GATT keyboard; types ASCII with a US layout |
| `ble_fido` | FIDO BLE transport (service 0xFFFD, CTAP 2.1 BLE framing, MTU fragmentation); CTAP is a pluggable handler, default answers "not supported" |

Security:
- IO capability DisplayOnly: the device shows a 6-digit passkey, the host types it (MITM-protected, LE Secure Connections).
- New hosts pair only inside the pairing window (`ble pair`); other pairing attempts are rejected.
- One connection at a time. `ble use` picks the target bond: keys released on the old host, link dropped, advertising filtered (accept list) to the target; a non-target bonded host that still gets through is dropped after encryption.
- Unauthenticated (Just Works) links are dropped; HID reports and FIDO characteristics require an authenticated link.

## Flash layout

The firmware `.bin` must be compatible with the stock reader firmware: some
readers have the USB flasher disabled, so they are flashed through the reader's
own OTA path. Keep the stock X4 Pro partition table, 16 MB, dual OTA:

| Name | Type | Offset | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| nvs | data/nvs | 0x009000 | 0x005000 |
| otadata | data/ota | 0x00E000 | 0x002000 |
| app0 | app/ota_0 | 0x010000 | 0x7E0000 |
| app1 | app/ota_1 | 0x7F0000 | 0x7E0000 |
| spiffs | data/spiffs | 0xFD0000 | 0x014000 |
| coredump | data/coredump | 0xFE4000 | 0x01C000 |

- On the X4 Pro only the app `.bin` is replaced: it runs on the **stock
  bootloader** (ESP-IDF 6.0.1). Bootloader settings in our `sdkconfig` do not
  apply there, so the app must not depend on them.
- The stock bootloader has app rollback enabled. A new app must call
  `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()` after it boots, or the bootloader
  falls back to the old slot.
- Stock X4 Pro Wi-Fi OTA accepts only an encrypted `.xota` package
  (`encrypted_v1`): the image is AES-encrypted with a per-channel key and
  checked against `plain_sha256` after decryption. We do not build `.xota`
  ourselves: we ship a plain app `.bin`, and the CrossPoint unlocker-tool
  packages and flashes it.
